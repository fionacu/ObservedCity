# Contributing to Observed City

Hello and welcome. It’s great to have you here! My name is Fiona, I’m a writer/editor from Birmingham UK, and I’m the sole person running this project – at this point. I need help (and feedback)! I hope you can help (and feed back!)…

The core of my project is to launch Birmingham UK’s first email newsletter covering data privacy, art, tech and activism. My aim is simple: to connect existing activity, build a collaborative network of local datanauts and to make data privacy easier for citizens to engage with – maybe even fun! UPDATE: the newsletter has now launched – [you can sign-up here](https://tinyletter.com/ObservedCity/).

Observed City launched on 22 March 2018 with a basic [newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/ObservedCity/) – and [website](http://observed.city), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ObservedCity), [Facebook closed discussion group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/observedcity/) – so that contributors can more easily see what I’m doing. From here on, I want to make it better – and that’s where I hope you can help.

This document offers a set of guidelines for contributing to Observed City on GitHub. These are guidelines, not rules. This guide is meant to make it easy for you to get involved.

* Participation guidelines
* What I’m working on
* How to submit changes
* How to report bugs
* ommunication channels

## Participation guidelines

This project adheres to a [code of conduct](https://github.com/fionacu/kickstart-the-city/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behaviour to observedcity@protonmail.com.

## What I’m working on

I’m new to Github so please let me know if you don’t understand what the project is about or if there is anything else that doesn’t make sense. So far I have filled out the main sections: 

[Roadmap](https://github.com/fionacu/kickstart-the-city/blob/master/Roadmap.md) – the short and medium goals are mostly done. I’m now looking at the long-term section and have opened a few Issues to help me improve future newsletters. I'm also in the process of turning the roadmap into end documentation for others to use as a guide to setting up a newsletter and kickstarting he data privacy conversation in their own cities.

[Readme](https://github.com/fionacu/kickstart-the-city/blob/master/README.md) – this has a roundup of the issues in the ‘How to help’ section. There seem to be a lot of [Issues](https://github.com/fionacu/kickstart-the-city/issues) where I’m mostly asking for feedback, or ideas to refine things or add new content but I'd also love some help with the design of a logo and maybe some guest contributions.

## How to submit changes

Mostly I’m asking for ideas or feedback on the work so far so please add comments under each issue. You can also propose changes by email: observedcity@protonmail.com. (Please put which issue you are feeding back on in the subject line if using email.)

If it is an issue that you can work on directly, you can submit a pull request and propose a change to the project repository. (I'm new to Github so will try my best to respond quickly.)

If this is your first time contributing to open source? Check out this free series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

## How to report bugs
Spotted a content mistake? Or other Please file any bugs, requests, or questions in the [Issues tracker](https://github.com/fionacu/kickstart-the-city/issues). 

## Communication channels

The main way to contact me is on email: observedcity@protonmail.com

You can also follow @ObservedCity on Twitter, although project development or feedback is better kept here on Github or at the email address. 

## Thank you!

Thanks in advance for your contributions. I'll give an attribution credit to any content/design contributions and will add a thank-you list of credits to the post-Global Sprint issue of the newsletter (issue 4, May/June 2018).

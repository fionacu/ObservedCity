# Kickstart the city

Hello and welcome. Bienvenue. Wilkommen. Selamat datang (practising my Indonesian there).

My name is Fiona and I'm a (former) journalist and digital content editor working in Birmingham, UK. Thankyou for reading 'Kickstart the city'. I hope anyone who has been involved in starting an online community can give me their advice because although I've worked on email content, I have not ever created one from scratch.  

I’m using my Mozilla Open Leadership Project to find and connect data activists, artists, researchers and other collaborators in Birmingham, UK, in order to reach a wider area of the population of the UK's second largest city. I want to help people understand their online lives better and improve their digital literacy so they can make more informed choices about their privacy.

I think the easiest, most personal and most inclusive way to do this is to connect the dots through a regular email newsletter that brings together everything interesting and engaging that is happening in the city that relates to our data – in art, tech, activism and research.

Contents might include: local listings for workshops and talks, reviews of art exhibitions, news of data projects that affect local citizens, comment and discussion around hot topics, such as 'Should you post photos of your kids on Facebook without their permission?', as well as breaking security/privacy news from around the world. 

I also hope that new alliances and activities will be created from building a collaborative community around this topic.

I've started a list of tasks in the [Roadmap section](https://github.com/fionacu/kickstart-the-city/blob/master/roadmap) - the initial phase is all about R&D and finding people with expertise in community building, but there will also be opportunities to get involved in the editorial side, the design of the email and other related content hubs. 

At a wider geographical level, I want to provide end-documentation of how to 'kickstart the city' for others to follow and I'm open to ideas and feedback on how best to do that.

Thanks for reading. Merci beaucoup. Vielen dank. Terima kasih banyak!

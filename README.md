# Observed.City

**Observed.City is Birmingham UK’s first email newsletter covering data privacy, art, tech and activism. It is new in the space and will connect activity and engage new audiences in an easy and direct way. My aim is to make data privacy more accessible, engaging and FUN!**

#Hello and welcome! 

Also Bienvenue. Wilkommen. Selamat datang (practising my Indonesian there).

Thank you for visiting the Observed.City project – you are kindly invited to join  and help develop this venture. Although this project is based in my hometown, I will produce end documentation to help others Kickstart the data privacy conversation in their own towns, cities and regions.

## The challenge

My city, like many others, lacks: 

1. Options to talk publicly and openly about data privacy. 

2. Engagement – people are too busy or unconcerned. 

3. Connection – things are happening but they are not well linked up or promoted.


## The solution

1. To launch an email newsletter that curates interesting events and happenings.

2. To support this with other online spaces (website and social media)

3. To build a community of experts (data researchers, academics, artists and activists) and citizens who want to learn the basics of online privacy.

## Who is behind this project?
My name is Fiona and I'm a (former) journalist and digital content editor working in Birmingham, UK. I am doing this alone but I aim to find more editors to help make this project sustainable.

I am being mentored through the Mozilla Open Leaders Project by Rachael Ainsworth, radio astronomer, open science champion and organiser of HER+Data community in Manchester, England. Here is her [github] (https://github.com/rainsworth).

## How to help
I've started a list of tasks in the [Roadmap section](https://github.com/fionacu/kickstart-the-city/blob/master/roadmap) - the initial phase is all about R&D and finding people with expertise in community building, but there will also be opportunities to get involved in the editorial side, the design of the email and other related content hubs. 

1. Feedback/thoughts – the launch issue has just come out: [Observed.City] (http://observed.city) General feedback/advice would be great. Email observedcity@protonmail.com

2. Community building – I need to build subscribers and get the word out. I've launched – so what are the next steps to maximise reach?

3. Content ideas – I want to help people understand their online lives better and improve their digital literacy so they can make more informed choices about their privacy. Contents might include: local event listings, news of data projects that affect local citizens, comment and discussion. But it has to be engaging or people won't come back. I'm playing with some ideas around a traffic light system for good/bad players. What do you think? Any other 'fun' ideas?

4. Code – I think there will be some options to help with creating a traffic light system. Eg, data mining terms and conditions of the big tech companies and rating them for length, readability, terms. Possible?

5. Design - I don't have a logo yet.

6. Editing - interesting in finding guest editors, or people with a lot of reach to do an intro. Any tech/privacy celebs out there? 

7. End documentation – how best to 'Kickstart the city' where you live. Looking at ideas on how best to do this. 

8. What haven't I thought of?

## Get in touch

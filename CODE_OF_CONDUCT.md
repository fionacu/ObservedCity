*Participation Guidelines

This project respects the following community participation guidelines. These guidelines cover our behaviour as participants, facilitators, project leads, and anyone else involved.

**How to treat each other

* Be respectful and welcoming
* Try to understand different perspectives
* Do not threaten violence
* Empower others
* Strive for excellence
* Don’t expect to agree with every decision
* Inclusion and Diversity

**Contribute

Observed City welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. It doesn’t matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you.

I welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively, including, but not limited to people of varied age, culture, ethnicity, gender, gender-identity, language, race, sexual orientation, geographical location and religious views. This project aims to be inclusive and to support diversity.

**Raising Issues

If you believe you‘re experiencing practices which don‘t meet the above policies, please immediately contact Fiona (project lead) at: observedcity@protonmail.com

**Working in the Open

Planning for the Observed City project is being done in the open on the [Kickstart the city Github] (https://github.com/fionacu/kickstart-the-city). I hope participants will benefit from this culture of transparency and collaboration.
